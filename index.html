        <h2>What we achevied with this project</h2>
        <p>We were able to learn about the strengths of the laws set on child employment and how much they reduce the cases of child labor. We had chosen to focus on Pakistan and had discovered that it was a country with over 3.3 million children under forced labor. Due to 2 teammates being from said country and having basic knowledge on this issue in their country, we chose Pakistan. However, forced labor is seen the most in countries in Africa and other developing countries in Asia. The way individuals have been brought up considerably affects their views on this issue. Many middle-class families choose to ignore the laws set and get their children to do labor as they need "extra hands" to support the family. Ultimately, child labor at times, takes away what could've been a prosperous future.</p>

        <h2>Our podcast</h2>
      <p>Our podcast is to raise the voice for those who are affected by child labor. I invited students, friends and parents that have been affected by child labor to their own home countries. I have invited people from Nigeria, Pakistan, India and more, this allowed our podcast to be as original and unscripted as possible. </p>
